# gRPC-Java
gRPC communication between different Java applications

This quick sample can be used as a base prototype to develop further applications. I decided to put it out there after one entire day of researching and testing to make sure everything was working properly. 
It took me a while once most of forums and tutorials are presenting some kind of problem.

There're a few questions you might be wondering about gRPC:
1. How is it helpful for app communication?
 - Whether it's locally or on cloud you can communicate through different applications using the same/different languages. Also if you have more than one main() method you can communicate between 'em.
 
2. gRPC or Kafka? 
 - Both have 'similar' functionalities. Basically for synchronous communication -> gRPC and asynchronous communication -> kafka. I suggest taking a look inside this topic https://www.quora.com/How-should-I-choose-between-gRPC-and-Kafka-when-building-microservices for a better understanding
